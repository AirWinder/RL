# Project of RL Based on or_gym 'VehicleRouting-v0'
This project is to using different algorithms (Q-learning, DynaQ, A2C) for training the agent in environment 'VehicleRouting-v0'.
Based on different algorithms and environment settings, we would like to know which algorithm is better in different environments.

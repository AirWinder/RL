# Project of RL Based on or_gym 'VehicleRouting-v0'
This project uses different algorithms (Q-learning, DynaQ, A2C) to train the agent in the environment 'VehicleRouting-v0'.
We would like to know which algorithm is better in different environments based on various algorithms and environment settings.

[This Project is done with Karthik Sharma([[Github linkksharma351998]](https://github.com/ksharma351998)), and guided by Professor Dehghani([[https://github.com/mdehghani86]](https://github.com/mdehghani86)https://github.com/mdehghani86]
